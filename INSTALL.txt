**IMPORTANT THE DCP DON'T WORK ON PLESK LOWER THAN VERSION 9!**

Install Instructions
Part 1

* Change into you Plesk Admin htdocs directory (e.g. `/opt/psa/admin/htdocs`)
* Make a directory for the DynDNS Control Panel (e.g. `mkdir dcp`)
* Set chown of the directory you made above to root:psaadm (`chown root:psaadm dcp`) 
* Set chmod of the directory you made above to 755 (`chmod 777 dcp`)
* Extract all files of the ZIP into that directory
* Set chown of all files to root:psaadm (`chown -R root:psaadm *`)
* Set chmod of all files to 755 (`chmod 755 -R *`)
* Set chmod of all txt files and directory dbs to 777 (`chmod 777 -R dbs/ *.txt`)
* Set the wrapper to chown root:root (`chown root:root sh/wrapper`)
* Set the wrapper to chmod 4755 (`chmod 4755 sh/wrapper`)
* Go into directory "dynupd" (`cd dynupd`) and make 2 symlinks 1. (`ln -s ../sh`) 2. (`ln -s ../dbs`)
* make your settings in file config.inc.php

The wrapper is compliled on a 64 bit system with Plesk 11. If you want (or have) to compile your own wrapper just do this:

cd sh
rm wrapper
gcc wrapper.c -o wrapper
strip wrapper
chown root:root wrapper
chmod 4755 wrapper

Login to your Plesk as admin and make a new Custom Button with the following settings:

* Button label: **Just choose a name**
* Location: **Domain administration page**
* Priority: **100**

* Context help tip contents: **whatever you want**
* Open URL in the Control Panel: **yes**
* Visible to all sub-logins: **yes ** (if your clients are allowed to use the glm) ["no" in Plesk 10.x]

Part 3
Make sure that the **SOA Settings** of your Domain-Nameserver are fit to use that domain as a DynDNS.

e.g.:
* TTL: **1 Minute**
* Refresh: **5 Minutes**
* Retry: 5 Minutes
* Expire: **1 Day**
* Minimum: **1 Hour**

**IF YOU'RE USING THE ADDONS WITH PLESK 10.x A SPECIAL CONTROLLER IS NEEDED!**
DOWNLOAD THE CONTROLLER AND INSTALL WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE INSTALL.txt
Download -> http://haggybear.de/download/psa10_controller.zip 

Since Plesk 10.4.x no additional controller is needed!

Thats it! Have Fun!
